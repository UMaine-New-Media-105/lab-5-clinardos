For this assignment, I used a 400 x 400 canvas with the p5.js software to first create a sprite. After creating my sprite, which I had just added a sprite I had made in a previous lab. Then the next task was to add movement of the sprite in both the x-direction and y-direction. I did this by using 4 variable: x1,y1,speedX,speedY. Next, I allowed x1/y1 to equal x1/y1 + speedX/speedY. This is what made the sprite move. I then created two if statement one for the x1 variable and one for the y1 variable. The if statement for each said if y1/x1 is greater than or equal to 300 or if y1/x1 is less than or equal to 0 then the speedX/Y should be multiplied by -1. For the last step of example 1, we needed to use the random function. This function allows p5.js to choose random number between two number you choose. I chose to add this to all if my variables and allowed the random value to be between 1-3

For this assignment, I used a duplicate of the above sketch still with a 400 x 400 canvs and using the p5.js software. The task was to use the keyPressed() function to change the direction of the sprite. I first created this as a seperate function at the bottom of the code. I then added if statements for each direction. A test and function were added for each arrow. The test being the arrow pressed and the function for each being the speedX/Y being multiplied by -1.
